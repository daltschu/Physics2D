            You can create as many 2D objects (colored discs) by tapping the screen
            with one finger. Each object is given a random mass (shown in the middle of the disc).
            Its initial position is where you tapped the screen, the initial speed is random.
        </p>
        <p class="explain">
            The objects will move on the screen. They will bounce off the edges, they will also tend to
            bounce on each other. The gravity force is pulling them down, as you can verify by
            tilting your handheld device. They will lose energy due to friction as they move on the screen.

            The following gestures are supported:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tap with one finger: create a new object.</li>
            <li>You can move an object to another location by touching it with one finger and
                dragging it.
            <li>Tap with two fingers: erase all the objects and start again.</li>
            <li>Tap with three fingers: shows this page.</li>
        </ul>
